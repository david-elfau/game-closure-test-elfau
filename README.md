## Technical Details
I've created a front end app which stores the data in cookies, because I didn't feel confortable

Technology used:
* Node.js: To have a simple enviroment to work
* React:I have select it as Frontend Library because: TODO
  * React hooks: To pass and save user state data.		
* Bootstrap: I have used because it provide easy way to create components
* Adobe XD: I have create the skeleton on XD and exported to html and css to save time, event it is not the best way yo proceed



### Data Management
Data is split in static and user data.
Static includes:
* Info about businesses
*
*
User data includes:
* State of the businesses
* Gold balance
* 

### Balancing details
I have taken as reference for the balancing the AdVenture Capitalist data. 
I took this sources:
* AdVenture Capitalist Wiki: https://adventure-capitalist.fandom.com/wiki/AdVenture_Capitalist_Wiki
* The Math of Idle Games: https://gameanalytics.com/blog/idle-game-mathematics.html 

I change this values:
* I have limited the max levels for business to 200 because I am importing the values througt JSON instead of show using a formula
* I have increase the production time in the first businesses to show the progress of the progress bar
